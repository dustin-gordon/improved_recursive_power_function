# improved_recursive_power_function
An improved implementation of my recursive power function to have better runtime efficiency. 

- The program prompts the user to enter the base and exponent for the power computation.
- The pow() is called recursively to repeat the sub-multiplications to find the total value of the power function.
- Negative powers are also supported.
- The orginal recursive implementation is included and ran in addition to the improved recursive function.
- The runtime for both are recorded and the perfomance benefit in runtime difference is displayed.
